# Processing-Bubbles


Project for SCAD ITGM 220, Winter 2023

Randomly generated bubbles in Java Processing.

Assignment was to generate a pattern using loops. I kinda went past the mark.

There are some toggleable settings in the main file. Setting clickable to true makes the project pauseable on any frame by clicking in the window.

See Process Book PDF for more information.
